My initial hardware consists of a mixture of components I already had, and components purchased for this project:

Arduino UNO
DS1307 RTC (on DFRobot board v1.1)
4 x 1/4 circle of 15 x WS2812 5050 RGB LEDs
1000 µF 50V capacitor
5V 5amp power supply
breadboard
wires

RTC
http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Real_Time_Clock_Module_(DS1307)_V1.1_(SKU:DFR0151)
The RTC in this is an DS1307, and the library I'm using is the DS1307RTC available from arduino.cc.

WS2812 RGB LEDs
The library I am using to communicate with the RGB LEDs is the Adafruit NeoPixel library v1.0.4.
