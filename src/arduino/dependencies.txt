My initial hardware consists of a mixture of components I already had, and components purchased for this project:

WeMos D1 mini (An ESP8266 board)
DS1302 RTC
4 x 1/4 circle of 15 x WS2812 5050 RGB LEDs
1000 µF 50V capacitor
5V 5amp power supply
breadboard
wires

RTC
The RTC in this is a borrowed DS1302 while I wait for an ordered DS3231 to arrive.
The library I'm using is the DS1302RTC available from http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DS1302

WS2812 RGB LEDs
The library I am using to communicate with the RGB LEDs is the Adafruit NeoPixel library v1.0.4.
